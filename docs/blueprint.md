## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep violet (#673AB7) for a touch of elegance and trendiness, reflecting the fashion aspect of the app.
- Background color: Very light violet (#F3E5F5), a desaturated version of the primary color, providing a gentle and clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Deep indigo (#3F51B5) to provide contrast to CTAs, drawing user attention to specific interactive elements.
- Font: 'Belleza' for headlines and short chunks of text, giving a personal, stylish feel, and 'Alegreya' for longer passages of text, lending the design an intellectual and literary touch.
- Use minimalist, custom-designed icons representing clothing items, shopping carts, hearts (for wishlists), and other relevant actions/categories. Maintain consistent line weight and a modern aesthetic.
- Employ a clean and organized layout. Use whitespace to separate elements, creating a sense of visual calm and focus on the fashion content. Consider a card-based layout for wishlist items.
- Incorporate subtle animations for transitions between screens and when interacting with items (e.g., adding to wishlist, price drop alerts). Ensure animations are smooth and don't distract from the shopping experience.
